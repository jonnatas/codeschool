For using the dev-env you have to do the follow steps:
    1. apt-get install docker
    2. apt-get install docker.io
    3. sudo docker pull gutorc92/codeschool
    4. sudo docker run -t -i -p 8001:8000 -v {codeschool files on host machine}:/usr/src/ codeschool /bin/bash 
    5. cd /usr/src/src
    6. python manage runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    7. Go to your web broser and try localhost:8001

If you already have docker e the codeschool image, you do not need to execute the steps from 1 to 3.
In order to have the newest version of the codeschool image, it should be a good practice pull the repository
before running the container. 
The command 6 have to be execute using the address 0.0.0.0 for permitting access from outside de container.
Once the host machine port 8001 is being used, you can choose another one.
